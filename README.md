# NoteFlow

README under construction!

## How it Started

NoteFlow started as a personal project I worked on over the 2021 Christmas break. At the time, I had little knowledge of React, and so opted to code everything using vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation.

This revised version of NoteFlow takes advantage of my progression within web development, and uses a combination of technology that I had not yet learnt during its previous iteration.

## The Problem?

I enjoy taking notes. Most of the time these notes end up in my anologue notebook, though, this isn't something I carry round with me. One of the big things I like to know when taking notes is when exactly did I make that entry. For example, if I'm writing notes whilst learning a new language or technology, I like to see my progression over time and what I was looking at last Thursday, or at 15:20 yesterday afternoon.

## The Solution

NoteFlow shows your notes in a nice, clean, chronological order. Displayed on a timeline, it's easy to see when you made your notes
